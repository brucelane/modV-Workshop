# modV-Workshop

By using the open source software [modV](https://modv.vcync.gl/) you will be able to create audio reactive visualisations by combining different kinds of visual modules (2D, [Interactive Shader Format](https://isf.video/) and WebGL Shader) with any kind of audio input like a microphone or your favorite music. In the end you will know all the basics in order to do your first live performance as a VJ.
